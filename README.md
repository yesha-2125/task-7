Task 7 – Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions
📘 Objective
To identify, review, and remove potentially harmful or unnecessary browser extensions that could pose security or privacy risks

🧰 Tools Used

Opened the browser and navigated to chrome://extensions/ to view all installed extensions.
Collected details such as name, permissions, user reviews, and source for each extension.
Analyzed their trustworthiness based on permissions and installation source.
Identified “AnyDoc Translator” as a suspicious extension due to third-party installation and unsafe permissions.
Removed the suspicious extension and verified the rest from the official Chrome Web Store.
Restarted the browser and observed performance improvements.
Researched how malicious extensions can harm users through data theft, tracking, and browser hijacking.
